The WilsonORMapper v4.* includes support for .NET v2.0 features.
  First, note you can run the .NET v1.1 version in .NET v2.0 as is.
  But you will need the .NET v2.0 version of the WilsonORMapper.dll
  if you want to take advantage of Generics and/or Nullable Types.
  You can find the .NET v2.0 binaries in the marked bin folders,
  and you can always differentiate the dlls by the descriptions.
  You can also compile the source yourself, for .NET v1.1 or v2.0,
  but you should use the version specific solution/project files.
  Note that the compiled help file does not include the .NET v2.0
  features since NDoc does not yet have a version for .NET v2.0.
  There are also no examples, but the usage is very much the same
  as for .NET v1.1 except you can use Generics and/or Nullables.
  Finally, note .NET v2.0 support is based on the RTM as of v4.2.
