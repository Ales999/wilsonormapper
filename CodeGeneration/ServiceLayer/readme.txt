These templates generate code similar to that included in WilsonORWrapper (i.e. repository, logging, and caching classes), without the need for the WilsonORWrapper DLLs. They are actually a precursor to WilsonORWrapper.

They are included in the public open source project for Wilson O/R Mapper ("WORM") as a convenience to developers.
