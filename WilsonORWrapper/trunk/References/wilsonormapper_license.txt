WilsonORMapper Documentation is Included: WilsonORMapper.htm.

WilsonORMapperDemo comes with a Demo version of WilsonORMapper.
  You are free to test it and fully evaluate WilsonORMapper.
  You are free to copy and share this Demo with others too.
  The Demo version is not lacking any features or functions.
  However, it will only run inside of VS.NET or Web Matrix.
  Purchasing the Licensed version enables the full run-time.

The Licensed Production version of WilsonORMapper costs US$50.
  This license, if purchased, grants full use to one person.
  That person can use it on any number of servers forever.
  That one person will also get any upgrades free forever.
  The production license also includes full C# source code.
  Additional developers should purchase separate licenses.

Please visit http://www.WilsonDotNet.com to purchase license.
  This site uses PayPal for all purchases of WilsonDotNet.
  There is just one item -- subscription includes WilsonORMapper.
  This US$50 purchase also entitles you to the site's code.
  This includes all the code on this site and all upgrades.
  This code is some of the most advanced available in .NET.

Finally, this is intentionally lacking of standard legalese,
but I should at least note that I am not liable for anything.
