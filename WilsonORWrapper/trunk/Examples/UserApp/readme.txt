
TO RUN THIS SAMPLE PROJECT:

1. Run the build.sql script against a local SQL 2000 or higher database. This creates a database named [usertest] with some test data.

2. Build the WilsonORWrapper assemblies (using NAnt).

3. Build the UserApp solution (using Visual Studio).

4. Run the unit test file tests.nunit (using NUnit).


IMPORTANT NOTES:

* Tests will not pass unless you have a licensed copy of Paul Wilson's O/R Mapper. Obtain one from http://www.ormapper.net.
