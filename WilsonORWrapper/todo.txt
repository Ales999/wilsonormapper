=========

* Debug handling of adding references? re-running templates tends to add 
	multiple invalid references
* App.config or Web.config -- autogenerate and add to existing project
* Automatic validation attribute generation:
		* ValidateNonEmpty for not null?
		* Validate_type_ based on data type?
* Option to add [AutoTrack] attribute via mappings file.

===============

* Refactor Save(Collection) to perform "smart save" -- insert new objects, update
	existing objects.

* Add AutoResync option to automatically resync objects after saving.

* Implement O/R mapper caching features.
 
* Allow retrieving a collection of objects using RetrieveByKey() method when
	passing an object referencing the one side of a one-to-many relationship.
		e.g. Team 1-to-many Player
			PlayerService.RetrieveByKey(team) returns collection of Players
	This should also allow sorting, which allows the retrieval of child objects
	while sorting.
		e.g. team.Players <-- returns unsorted collection
			 PlayerService.RetrieveByKey(team, "lastname asc") <-- returns sorted 
			 collection

* Allow retrieving a collection of child objects (many side of one-to-many 
	relationship) using a custom collection which allows filtering and sorting.
		e.g. Team one-to-many Player
			 team.Players.OrderBy(...)
			 team.Players.Where(...)
	Can also be combined:
		e.g. team.Players.Where(...).OrderBy(...)
